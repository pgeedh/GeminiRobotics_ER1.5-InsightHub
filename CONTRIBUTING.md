# Contributing to Awesome Gemini Robotics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this **Awesome Resource Hub**! 🚀

As an **Early Trusted Tester**, I am sharing these patterns to help the community build faster. I welcome contributions from researchers, hobbyists, and engineers who want to expand this collection.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### 1. Adding a Use Case
Found a new way to use Gemini ER 1.5? (e.g., "Safety Checking" or "Text Reading").
1.  Create a script in `examples/`.
2.  Add a generic image or GIF to `assets/` (or use a public link) showing the result.
3.  Submit a PR with the tag `[USE-CASE]`.

### 2. Improving Documentation
See a typo? Want to clarify a prompt pattern?
- PRs for `README.md` and `RESOURCES.md` are highly encouraged.
- Please stick to the "Professional & Clean" aesthetic.

### 3. Reporting Issues
- If a script doesn't work with the latest API version, please open an Issue tagged `[BUG]`.
- For model-specific feedback (hallucinations, refusal), please use the official Google AI Studio feedback tools.

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct

We strive for:
- **Safety First**: Do not share prompts that bypass robot safety protocols (e.g., "ignore collision").
- **Respect**: Be kind to fellow roboticists.
- **Innovation**: Focus on constructive, novel uses of VLA technology.
